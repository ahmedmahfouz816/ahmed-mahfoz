<font size="5">COVID-19 is mainly spread through close contact and droplets that come from your nose and mouth. For example, from someone who is talking loud, singing, shouting, coughing or sneezing.

    This happens when people are within 1 to 2 metres of each other.
    
    That's why keeping a 2 metre distance from other people is an important way of reducing the spread of COVID-19.</font>

<font size="5">Airborne transmission is the spread of a virus in very tiny water particles, known as aerosols. This can happen over a longer distance than droplets, such as across a room.

    COVID-19 can spread easily in crowded or poorly ventilated areas.
    
    To protect against airborne transmission, keep indoor spaces aired out (ventilated) by opening windows and doors when possible. This reduces the risk of infected air building up in a room, corridor or stairwell.
    
    It's much safer to meet people outdoors than indoors, even if you keep more than 2 metres apart indoors.
    
    Avoid crowded or stuffy places as much as possible. Leave a location if it becomes crowded.</font>
